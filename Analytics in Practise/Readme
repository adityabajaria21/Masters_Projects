Built a review propensity model that identifies likely 4 to 5 star reviewers, enabling targeted prompts and incentives rather than blanket campaigns. 

Translated scores into an actionable targeting plan, with probability thresholds that balance scale, hit rate, and budget, so marketing can pick the optimal cut off for each campaign. 

Reduced incentive waste by focusing on high likelihood customers, improving cost per positive review compared with untargeted outreach. The targeting table in the report shows trade offs by threshold choice. 

Surfaced clear operational levers for CX and logistics, faster and more reliable deliveries correlate with higher positive review rates, which informs SLA priorities and post purchase messaging. 

Provided category and customer insights that guide merchandising and CRM, certain product groups and repeat purchase signals lift review positivity, which supports smarter campaign segmentation. 

Established business ready evaluation, precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC, plus simple calibration checks, so leaders understand accuracy and risk at decision time. 

Delivered stakeholder friendly artefacts, an executive pitch for management and a technical report for analytics teams, aligned with the assignmentâ€™s CRISP DM and presentation requirements. 

Created a reproducible path to deployment, a clean analytical base table, feature logic, and model selection criteria, which shortens time to integrate with CRM triggers and marketing automation. 

Linked model outputs to commercial outcomes, higher review volume and quality, stronger buyer trust, and improved marketplace reputation, which supports conversion and seller performance. 

Framed success criteria for future A/B tests, compare targeted versus generic prompts on positive review rate and cost per positive review, then tune the threshold by business goal.
